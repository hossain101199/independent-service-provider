      <h5>Difference between authorization and authentication</h5>
      <p>
        Authentication It is the process of making sure that the attributes of a
        single piece of data, as claimed by an actual person or group, are true.
        Authentication People who do this look at the information about an
        entity in order to figure out who it is. Authentication Has ways to
        check the credentials of a user. Authentication makes sure that a person
        is who they say they are before giving them access to a system. People
        usually need a username and password in order to be able to get into
        things. Authorization It refers to the task or process of setting access
        privileges and rights for the resources that deal with data security.
        Authorization Checks the permissions of a user before giving them
        access. Authorization Has ways to check the permissions of a user. An
        online authorization based on the permissions that he or she has been
        given. Authorization shows whether or not a person is allowed to use
        certain resources. Security levels are likely to have a big impact on
        what factors are important for people to be able to do. After a person
        has been authenticated, he or she is authorized.
